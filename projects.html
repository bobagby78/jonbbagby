            <p>What's Sup was a group capstone project I completed with three other people during the optional Liftoff
                extension to the LaunchCode Web development training I attended in 2020. The main features of the app were
                the "My Kitchen" view, where users could keep track of the proteins, spices, condiments and sides in their
                pantry via form submission. Users can also upload recipes to the database to choose from on the "Recipes"
                view. Once the database is loaded with pantry items and recipes, users can then use the "Match Recipes"
                feature which shows a list of recipes the user can cook based on their pantry items and the recipes in the
                database. Users would be able to choose from their own recipes to match, or other user's recipes.

            <p>The Dungeon is the first project I started out of LaunchCode. It has always been a work in progress and
                is a playground I use to learn and try out new skills on the front end and back end of web Development.
                The Dungeon uses Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and Java to move information between the back and front ends.
                It stores information entered by users in a MySQL database. The end goal of the Character Builder is to
                be able to create a printable D&D character sheet and store that character in a database.

            <p>Critical Roll is an Android dice roller app that I developed on Android Studio. This is the first project
                I have developed using Android Studio, so it is a little rough around the edges. I learned Kotlin in the
                process of developing the app, and it has been a valuable resource in learning about XML and working with
                the Android Studio design interface.

            <p> My Garage is my next project on the horizon. It will be a java-based web app (and will most likely have
                a Kotlin Android counterpart) designed for the home mechanic. It will have a garage portal where users can
                import their vehicles that they own and work on to save to the database. It will have a service portal
                where users can keep track of regular maintenance performed on each of the vehicles in their garage.
                I would also like to play around with a social aspect where users can reach out to others on the app
                and ask questions, share photos, etc.
