        Hey, I'm Jon.

    <p>
        I taught high school Spanish teacher for thirteen years,
        but my passion for the craft waned during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.
        I had always been fascinated by computers and technology, so I decided to make my hobby a career.
        My experience in teaching has given me the soft skills to work with a wide variety of people and years of
        experience as a leader who thrives on bringing people together to collaborate on projects.
        I have been working for two years as a full-time, full-stack PHP web developer.
        In that time I have solidified my knowledge of web development using the LAPP stack.
